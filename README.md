## Project Overview

The **Minishell** project from 42 School introduces:
- The fundamentals of **shell programming**  
- **Process creation**, **pipes**, and **redirections**  
- Handling **signals**, **environment variables**, and **built-in commands**

This project is all about recreating a simplified version of the Bash shell —  
learning how a real shell parses commands, executes processes, and manages the environment 🐚

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master **process control** with `fork`, `execve`, and `wait`  
- Implement **I/O redirections** and **pipes**  
- Manage **signals** like `ctrl+C`, `ctrl+D`, and `ctrl+\`  
- Handle **environment variables** dynamically  
- Build a modular, robust, and readable C program

🤝 **Project developed in collaboration with [Fabio Vitharana](https://github.com/FabzHub17)**.  
📅 **Repository will be updated as new features are implemented!**
